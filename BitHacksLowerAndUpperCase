BitHack1: Convert Uppercase Character to Lowercase.
We can do it by performing Bitwise OR operation between the given character and space. Yeah, SPACE

CodeSnippet:

for(char ch = 'A'; ch <= 'Z'; ch++) {
    cout << char(ch | ' ');
}

Output: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz


BitHack2: Convert Lowercase Character to Uppercase.
We can do it by performing Bitwise AND operation between the given character and underscore. Yeah, I mean `_`

CodeSnippet:

for(char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
  cout << char(ch & '_');
}

Output: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

That's it. I know things are strange here. It's the Universe of Bits.

Keep Learning!
