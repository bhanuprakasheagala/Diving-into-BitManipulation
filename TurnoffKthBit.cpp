/*
Using the expression ~ (1 << (k-1)), we get a number with all its bits set, except the k'th bit. If we do a bitwise AND of this expression with the given number n,
we get a number which has all bits the same as n except the k'th bit which will be set to 0.

Example:
n = 12 and
k = 3

12                          00001100  &
~(1 << (3-1))               11111011
                          -----------
Result = 8                  00001000
 
 Here we can see that in the Result, all bits are same as n(here, n = 12) except third bit(Remember, We count bits from right to left).
